# Introduction
The Domotics Pad Android Client is able to talk to Indigo using several different techniques, depending upon the operation.

In these instances, Domotics Pad relies on an Indigo Plugin to extend Indigo's functionality. Domotics Pad will run without completing these steps, but with reduced functionality.
